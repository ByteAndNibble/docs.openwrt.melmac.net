## How to install

Install `luci-theme-material-old` from Web UI or connect to your router via ssh and run the following commands:

```sh
opkg update
opkg install luci-theme-material-old
```

If these packages are not found in the official feed/repo for your version of OpenWrt/LEDE Project, you will need to add a custom repo to your router following instructions on [GitHub](https://docs.openwrt.melmac.net/#on-your-router)/[jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stangri/docs.openwrt.melmac.net/README.md#on-your-router) first.

These packages have been designed to be backwards compatible with OpenWrt 19.07, OpenWrt 18.06, LEDE Project 17.01 and OpenWrt 15.05. However, on systems older than OpenWrt 18.06.6 and/or a system which has deviated too far (or haven't been updated to keep in-sync) with official OpenWrt release you may get a message about missing `luci-compat` dependency, which (and only which) you can safely ignore and force-install the luci app using `opkg install --force-depends` command instead of `opkg install`.

## How to use

Open the WebUI System->System page (usually at <http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/system/system),> select `Language and Style` tab and select `Material_Old` from `Design` drop-down.
